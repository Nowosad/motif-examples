# Motif: an open-source R tool for pattern-based spatial analysis

## Requirements

To reproduce the following case studies, you need to install several R packages and download a set of data files.
You can find the packages' installation code in [`R/package-installation.R`](R/package-installation.R) and all of the steps neccesary to download the data are in [`R/data-download.R`](R/data-download.R).

## Case studies

1. Basic signatures - [`R/basic-signatures.R`](R/basic_signatures.R)
2. Spatial pattern search - [`R/search.R`](R/search.R)
3. Spatial pattern comparision - [`R/comparision.R`](R/comparision.R)
4. Spatial pattern clustering - [`R/clustering.R`](R/clustering.R)
